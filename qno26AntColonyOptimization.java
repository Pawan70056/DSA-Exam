// Answer:

// Heuristic and Metaheuristic:

// Heuristic:
// A heuristic is a problem-solving approach that uses practical methods or rules to find a satisfactory solution, but not necessarily the
//  optimal one. Heuristics are typically employed when it is difficult or impossible to find an optimal solution in a reasonable amount 
//  of time. These methods often rely on experience, intuition, or domain-specific knowledge to guide the search for a solution.

// Metaheuristic:
// Metaheuristics are higher-level strategies or frameworks for solving optimization problems. Unlike specific heuristics, metaheuristics 
// are general-purpose techniques that can be applied to a wide range of problems. They provide a flexible and adaptable approach to 
// optimization by guiding the search process in a way that balances exploration of the solution space with exploitation of promising regions. 
// Metaheuristics often involve mechanisms for generating and evaluating candidate solutions, as well as strategies for iteratively improving
//  upon them.

// Example of a Problem Solved Using Metaheuristic Approach:

// One common example of a problem solved using metaheuristics is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the shortest 
// possible route that visits each city in a given set exactly once and returns to the original city. Since finding the optimal solution to 
// large instances of the TSP is computationally expensive, metaheuristic approaches such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), 
// and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are often employed to find good approximate solutions in a reasonable amount of time.

// Genetic Algorithm (GA):

// Genetic algorithms are a class of metaheuristic optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. 
// The basic idea behind genetic algorithms is to maintain a population of candidate solutions (often represented as chromosomes or individuals) 
// and iteratively apply genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population towards better solutions over 
// successive generations.

// Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for TSP:

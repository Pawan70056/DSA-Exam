// Discuss the detail about P, np, np-hard, and np-complete problems with example.


// Answer:

// Certainly! Let's discuss P, NP, NP-hard, and NP-complete problems along with examples:


// 1. **P Problems**:
//    - These are decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
//    - Solutions to P problems can be verified in polynomial time.
//    - Examples: 
//      - Sorting a list of numbers using algorithms like Quicksort or Mergesort.
//      - Finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

// 2. **NP Problems**:
//    - NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time".
//    - These are decision problems for which a given solution can be verified in polynomial time, but finding the solution may require non-polynomial time.
//    - Examples:
//      - The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)  
//    - The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT): 

// 3. **NP-hard Problems**:
//    - NP-hard problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP but may not be in NP themselves.
//    - These problems do not necessarily have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.
//    - Examples:
//      - The Halting Problem: Given a program and its input, determine whether the program finishes running or will run forever.
//      - The Knapsack Problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit, and the total value is as large as possible.

// 4. **NP-complete Problems**:
//    - NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP.
//    - Every problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-complete problem in polynomial time.
//    - If an efficient algorithm for solving any NP-complete problem is discovered, it would imply that P = NP.
//    - Examples:
//      - SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Problem)
//      - TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)
//      - Vertex Cover: Given a graph, find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.
